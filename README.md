# Project Setup Instructions

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the environment, cloning the project, and installing the required packages.

1. **Create and Activate a New Conda Environment**:
   - Open your command line interface and run:
     ```bash
     conda create --name myenv
     conda activate myenv
     ```

2. **Clone the Project Repository**:
   - Use the following commands to clone the project and navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Larsosterholt/mas417_project.git
     cd mas417_project
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Install the `nameTagLib` package using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install dist/nameTagLib-0.1.0.tar.gz
     ```

After completing these steps, your environment should be set up with all the necessary dependencies, and you'll be ready to run and use the project.
